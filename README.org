* Cooperation based on Aspiration
** Aspiration levels determined by the habituation
   A_{t+1} = A_{t}(1-h) + \pi_{t} h
** Satisfaction determined by aspiration
   s_{t} = tanh(\beta (A_{t} - \pi_{t}))
** Probability of cooperation
   Determined by the satisfaction and the action of the player in the last round.
* Rewiring
